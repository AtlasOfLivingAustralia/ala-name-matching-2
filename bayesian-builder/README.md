# Bayesian Builder

The classes in this module perform two tasks:

* They generate code that can be used to implement a bayesian network.
* They take source information that can be used to generate classifiers for an network and
  turn the result into a searchable data store containing information about matching,
  classification and conditional probabilities.

These two functions should, probably, be split apart; they're only here as a by-product of initial development.
But here we are.

Generally, for a specific network you should use the [maven plugin](../bayesian-maven-plugin/README.md) 
to generate the code and the CLI generated by the plugin to actually build the index.
