# ALA Taxonomic Tools

Some useful tools for processing and analysing ALA namematching indexes.

* [ALAComparisonTool](src/main/java/au/org/ala/names/tools/ALAComparisonTool.java) takes an input file of name 
* and location information and makes  comparison matches with the old namematching algorithm, along with a rough classification
  of what the comparison is telling us.
* [ALAMatchTool](src/main/java/au/org/ala/names/tools/ALAMatchTool.java) takes an input file of name and location information and makes
    comparison matches with the old namematching algorithm, along with a rough classification
    of what the comparison is telling us.
* [Index Converter Tool](src/main/java/au/org/ala/names/tools/IndexConverterTool.java) Converts a new-style index into
  and old-style index for systems what use the old name matching library
