# Core Bayesian Network Library

This module contains the classes needed to use the Bayesian network system.
Code generated by the [builder](../bayesian-builder/README.md) and domain-specific
implementations inherits from these classes.

The core classes are designed to be agnostic about what Bayesian network is being
used and what technology is used to store, retrieve and match classifiers.
See [the documentation](../doc/index.md) for more information about Bayesian networks
and [the lucene module](../bayesian-lucene/README.md) for the classifier implementation
used by the ALA.
